## Phase 2
Phase 2 was about finding relations between dataset characteristics and classifier performance.  
Additionally we tried to improve the architecture of SS3 to facilitate generalisation.  
For further information please have a look at the **[Wiki](https://gitlab.lrz.de/nlp-lab-course-ss2020/opinion-mining/opinion-lab-group-1.5/-/wikis/03.-Phase-2)**.

- `util.py`: Code to calculate dataset metrics 
- `class_specific_a__init__.py`: Changes to the pyss3 framework, so that we can use class specific $`alpha`$ values. Changes are marked with `Changed by NLP Lab` comment.
- `class_specific_s_l_p__init__.py`: Changes to the pyss3 framework, so that we can use class specific $`\sigma, \lambda, \rho`$ values. Changes are marked with `Changed by NLP Lab` comment.
