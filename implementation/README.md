# Implementation
The implementation is structured into the Phases described in the **[Wiki](https://gitlab.lrz.de/nlp-lab-course-ss2020/opinion-mining/opinion-lab-group-1.5/-/wikis/Home)**.

- Phase 1: Can SS3 perform Entity-/Attribut Classification?
- Phase 2: How can we improve SS3 architecturally and for which datasets is SS3 suited?
- Phase 3: Why does SS3 perform well on Beer Review Dataset and bad on City Review Dataset (both Aspect Extraction)?
